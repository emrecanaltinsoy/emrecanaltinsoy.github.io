Hey! I'm Emrecan.

I'm currently a Technical Lead at Schneider Electric, working on a
virtual agent project. Before that, I spent years in China doing my
master's and Ph.D. in Computer Vision. That experience shaped how I
think about problems and build things.

These days I bounce between AI, full-stack development, and
DevOps/MLOps. I like understanding how things work end-to-end.

When I'm not at a keyboard, you'll probably find me at the gym, on a
hiking trail, cycling somewhere, or trying to stay upright while
wakeboarding. I also have a habit of picking up random hobbies like
3D printing, tufting, or whatever catches my attention next.

If you're around and want to grab a coffee or chat about tech
(or anything else), feel free to reach out. I'm always up for
meeting new people.
