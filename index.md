`snippet-diary` is a Jekyll blog theme designed for quickly publishing snippets and short notes. It was built on top of [jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console) with many small changes:

- Catpucchin theme options, JetBrains Mono font
- User's preferred style (light/dark) is used by default
- New posts do not require `YYYY-MM-DD` in filename
- Last modified date from git history can be used using custom Jekyll plugin
- Posts arranged by tags in archive (Planned)
- Add new post using `gistid` option (Planned)

To add new snippets or notes, you can create new `*.md` files in `_posts` directory and you will see will see theme here:
